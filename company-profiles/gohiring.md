GoHiring

We digitize and automate recruiting workflows.
Our background

We (the founders of GOhiring) have been dealing with job advertisements for over 12 years.

In 2007 we started one of the first “AI Powered” recruitment matching providers. But the time was not yet ripe for it. In 2009 we then set up 1000jobboersen.de, the first agency in the German-speaking region to focus on online job advertisements, and sold it to ATS Softgarden in 2012. We had a bigger vision in mind that we needed to be independent for and that we approached when we founded GOhiring.

We love to share, learn and grow with another through collaboration and the challenges we tackle together. We can truly say that we benefit from the different strengths and skills everyone brings to the team. To keep that strength, we would like to grow wisely. Feel free to join our #remote-culture team from the place you’re most productive at which can also include our Berlin office space.
Company technologies

We took the chance to define our way of working in the way we like it: extremely digital, connected via best tools and especially #remotefirst. The company was setup from the beginning to support a flexible collaboration and work life, including travel for everyone. Even though not all of us are travelling and taking our jobs with us, we are on a mission to take remote work to the next level
